    <h1>The Prayer of Rest</h1>
    <h3>Our Father, who is in heaven, Hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For One who dwells in the shelter of the Most High Will lodge in the shadow of the Almighty. We will say to You, “My refuge and my fortress, My God, in whom I trust!” For it is You who rescues us from the net of the trapper And from the deadly plague. You will cover us with Your pinions, And under Your wings we may take refuge; Your faithfulness is a shield and wall. We will not be afraid of the terror by night, Or of the arrow that flies by day; Of the plague that stalks in darkness, Or of the destruction that devastates at noon. A thousand may fall at our side And ten thousand at our right hand, But it shall not approach us. We will only look on with our eyes And see the retaliation against the wicked. For we have made You, our refuge, The Most High, our dwelling place. No evil will happen to us, Nor will any plague come near our tent. For You will give Your angels orders concerning us, To protect us in all our ways. On their hands they will lift us up, So that we do not strike a foot against a stone. We will walk upon the lion and cobra, We will trample the young lion and the serpent. The Lord is our shepherd, we will not be in need. You let us lie down in green pastures; You leads us beside quiet waters. You restore our souls; You guide us in the paths of righteousness For the sake of Your name. Even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we fear no evil, for You are with us; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort us. You prepare a table before us in the presence of our enemies; You have anointed our heads with oil; Our cups overflow. Because we have loved You, You will save us; You will set us securely on high, because we have known Your name. We will call upon You, and You will answer us; You will be with us in trouble; You will rescue us and honor us. You will satisfy us with a long life, And show us Your salvation. Certainly goodness and faithfulness will follow us all the days of our lives, God's kingdom will reign forever, And our dwelling will be in the house of the Lord forever and ever,<br>Amen.</h3>
