    <h1>The Sinner's Prayer</h1>
    <h3>Heavenly Father, I believe you sent Your son, Jesus Christ, to die for me on the cross of Calvary, and He rose again on the 3rd day. <br>I repent of all my sins, and I receive Jesus into my heart as my Lord, and my savior, <br>Fill me, Lord, with Your Holy Spirit. Help me to work in holiness, And righteousness, In Jesus's Name,<br>Amen!</h3>
